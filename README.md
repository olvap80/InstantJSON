# InstantJSON
Under construction (implementation in progress)

Quick and simple header only JSON parser/serializer with "var" like object model.
Manipulate parsed JSON with DOM style objects directly from C++ as easy as JavaScript operates with native JavaScript objects.
You can use InstantJSON::Var as a universal "variant" data type to store and manipulate different data types (even when you do not need parsing/serializing support).
